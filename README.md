Impact of climate, comorbidities, and medications on heat-related illness in Italy, Romania, Belgium, and the UK using THIN and CPRD databases and mixed effect modelling from 2015 to 2023.

## Summary
This study analyzed heat-related illness patterns across Belgium, Italy, Romania, and the UK using health data from CPRD GOLD and THIN databases (2015-2023). We found that older adults had the highest heat illness burden, peaking between 2020-2022, with significant geographic differences in heat vulnerability across countries. Wet bulb temperature was strongly linked to illness risk in Belgium and Romania, moderately in Italy, but not in the UK. The effects of comorbidities and medications were most pronounced in Romania.
Our analysis used CPRD GOLD and THIN data mapped to the OMOP Common Data Model, applying mixed-effects models to examine how climate conditions, health status, and medications influence heat-related health outcomes across four European nations over nine years. The findings reveal the need for country-specific heat adaptation strategies and help identify vulnerable populations for targeted public health interventions.
